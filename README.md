# To-Do List App
This website is a simple to-do list app where the user can add list items, strike them off by using the checkbox and clear the list to start over. The front-end of the website was 
made using HTML and CSS. The back-end was made using Node.js (with Express.js). EJS was also used for easier data transmission between front and back-end. The website is hosted on Heroku: https://ancient-cliffs-26779.herokuapp.com (please press the clear list option before exiting)
